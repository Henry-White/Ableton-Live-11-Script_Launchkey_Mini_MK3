# Ableton-Live-11-Script_Launchkey_Mini_MK3
This is the MIDI Remote Scripts for Launchkey Mini MK3 for Ableton Live 11.  
  
## Goal:
* Add function `Arm Track` for button `Stop Solo Mute`;
* Add navigation with `Track left and Right buttons` for `Device` mode.

## Release info:
This is `Alpha` version. It is compiled but not functioning due issue with `MIDI device responded with wrong product id ((0, 32, 41, 19, 1, 0, 0) != (0, 32, 41, 2, 1, 0, 0)).`.
